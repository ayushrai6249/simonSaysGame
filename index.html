        <p>The Simon Says game begins upon pressing a key or clicking the "Start" button. The objective is to replicate
            the sequence of flashing colors generated by the computer for as many levels as possible. As the game
            progresses, the computer adds a new color to the sequence after each successful repetition. The player must
            click the corresponding buttons to match the order in which the colors were flashed.
            <br>
            The player's score is determined by the number of levels completed successfully. Visual cues, such as
            changing background images and flashing effects on buttons, provide feedback throughout the game. If the
            player clicks the wrong button or fails to complete the sequence, the game ends, displaying a "GAME OVER"
            message with the final score. To restart, the player can press any key or click the "Start" button again
